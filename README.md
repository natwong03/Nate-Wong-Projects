# Nate-Wong-Projects
This is a collection of my personal projects and projects I have made in my classes at Chapman University.

The .zip files starting with WongN are from my Computer Science I class and are written in Python3.
The other 3 .zip files are just a few of my projects from my Visual Programming course that I wrote in C#. The programs are also
tied to the Unity Editor, so to use them and try them out, please load them into Unity version 2019.4.9f1 since that is the version our
course instructor had us build and submit our projects in. Instructions are attached to each project to test and use them.
