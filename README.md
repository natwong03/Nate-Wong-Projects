# Nate-Wong-Projects
This is a collection of my personal projects and projects I have made in my classes at Chapman University.

The NLP_Project.zip file is the Natural Language Processor project from my Computer Science I class. It takes a .txt file and
counts the number of occurrences of unique words, then sorting the list from most to least repeated and returning it to a new
.txt file. The other 5 .zip files are just a few of my projects from my Visual Programming course that I wrote in C#.
The programs are also tied to the Unity Editor, so to use them and try them out, please load them into Unity version 2019.4.9f1
since that is the version our course instructor had us build and submit our projects in. README instructions are attached to each
project to test and use them.
